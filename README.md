> First, create the file `launch.json` in the `.vscode` folder following the example `launch.json.example`, and add the values of the `dart-define (Environment variables)` in the `toolArgs` parameter.

Now you must execute the following commands to obtain the packages and generate the necessary code:

- Get flutter dependencies in the project
```sh
$ make fc_packages
# or
$ flutter pub get
```
- Generate neccessary code 
```sh
$ make fc_build
# or
$ dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```
- Generate localizations
```sh
$ make fc_slang
# or 
$ dart run slang
```
- Generate neccesary code in package FC Api Client
```sh
$ make fc_api_client_build
# or
$ cd packages/fc_api_client && dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```
- Generate neccesary code in package FC Common
```sh
$ fc_common_build:
# or
$ cd packages/fc_common && dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```
- Generate neccesary code in package FC Api Domain
```sh
$ make fc_domain_build
# or
$ cd packages/fc_domain && dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

This project contains 3 flavors:

- development
- staging
- production

To run the desired flavor either use the launch configuration in VSCode/Android Studio or use the following commands:

```sh
# Development
$ flutter run --flavor development --target lib/main_development.dart

## Working with Translations üåê

This project relies on [slang][slang_link] type-safe i18n solution using JSON files.

### Adding Strings

1. To add a new localizable strings, open the `myFeatureName.json` file at `lib/i18n/en/myFeatureName.json`.

```json
{
    "appName": "Flut Cast"
}
```

2. Then add a new key/value and description

```json
{
    "appName": "Flut Cast"
}
```

3. Use the new string

```dart
import 'package:flut_cast/i18n/translations.g.dart';

@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Text(texts.misc.appName);
}
```

### Adding Supported Locales

Update the `CFBundleLocalizations` array in the `Info.plist` at `ios/Runner/Info.plist` to include the new locale.

```xml
    ...

    <key>CFBundleLocalizations</key>
	<array>
		<string>en</string>
		<string>es</string>
	</array>

    ...
```

### Adding Translations

1. For each supported locale, add a new Json file in `lib/i18n`.

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ i18n
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ en
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ misc.json
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ myFeature.json
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ es
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ misc.json
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ myFeature.json
```

2. Add the translated strings to each `.json` file:

> IMPORTANT: slang does not support \_ or - for file names. You must use camelcase. Example `myFeatureName.json`

`i18n/en/myFeatureName.json`

```json
{
    "appName": "Flut Cast",
    "temperature": "Temperature"
}
```

`i18n/es/myFeatureName.json`

```json
{
    "appName": "Flut Cast",
    "temperature": "Temperatura"
}
```

### Generating Translations

To use the latest translations changes, you will need to generate them:

```sh
$ make fc_slang
# or
$ dart run slang
```
